# ZRC-Stealth

ZRC-Stealth is the next step in blockchain privacy — combining stealth addresses and privacy pools into a single, dual-layer system that closes every gap in current cryptocurrency privacy solutions.

In today's blockchain environment, transactions are pseudonymous, leaving a permanent trail that chain analysis can trace back to users. Even so-called "private" solutions often hide only the sender or the recipient — never both.

ZRC-Stealth changes that.

## The Problem Today

- **Traditional transactions** reveal both sender and recipient.
- **Privacy pools** hide senders but still expose recipients.
- **Stealth addresses** hide recipients but still expose senders.

## The Complete Privacy Solution

By layering privacy pools with stealth addresses, ZRC-Stealth achieves total transaction confidentiality:

- **Sender Hidden**: Privacy pool deposits and withdrawals unlink the transaction origin.
- **Recipient Hidden**: Unique, one-time stealth addresses ensure recipients are never linked to their public addresses.
- **Amount Obfuscated**: Mixed withdrawals break any link between sender, recipient, and amount.

## How It Works

### 1. Deposit & Mix (Privacy Pool)
- The sender deposits into a pool shared with many others.
- Funds are mixed and anonymized using zero-knowledge proofs.

### 2. Generate Stealth Address
- The sender uses the recipient's public stealth meta-address to generate a unique, one-time receiving address.
- Only the recipient can identify and control this address.

### 3. Anonymous Withdrawal
- The sender withdraws from the privacy pool directly to the stealth address.
- The funds arrive in a Safe wallet with full security and programmable features.

### 4. Complete Anonymity
- No traceable link between sender and recipient.
- No exposure of transaction amounts.
- No correlation through timing analysis.
